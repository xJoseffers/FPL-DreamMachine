# FPL-DreamMachine
A python script made with the goal to automate the Fantasy Premier League game. 

Goals:

1. We are going to need to get data on which players are in our team, data on Premier League teams, data on Premier League players and data on what fixtures are coming up.

2. We need to know what number gameweek is coming up and we want to know if a deadline is within 24 hours so we only make a change before the deadline.

3. We need to give a weighting to each player on our selected team based on their form, their upcoming fixtures and whatever other data we decide to use and pick one to transfer out.

4. We need to give a weighting to each player that we could potentially pick based on their form, their upcoming fixtures and whatever other data we decide to use and pick one to transfer in.

5. We need to give a weighting to each player on our selected team based on their form, their upcoming fixtures and whatever other data we decide to use and pick 11 players to start and which one is captain.

6. We need to post our team to the website using the FPL API.

7. We need to make a Lambda layer that includes Pandas.

8. We need to deploy our code to Lambda and add a trigger to run the code every day.
