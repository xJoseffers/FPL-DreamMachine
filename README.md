# FPL-DreamMachine
A python script made with the goal to automate the Fantasy Premier League game. 

TO DO:

Create web scraping tool for bookie odds via Selenium.

Integrate odds against every Premier League team and add as variable for player selection. 

Goals:

1. We are going to need to get data on which players are in our team, data on Premier League teams, data on Premier League players and fixture data.

2. We need to know the upcoming gameweek, and if we're within a deadline to make changes.

3. We need to give a weighting to each player on our selected team based on their form, their upcoming fixtures and whatever other data we decide to use and pick one to transfer out.

4. We need to give a weighting to each player that we could potentially pick based on their form, their upcoming fixtures and whatever other data we decide to use and pick one to transfer in.

5. We need to give a weighting to each player on our selected team based on their form, their upcoming fixtures and whatever other data we decide to use and pick 11 players to start and which one is captain.

6. We need to post our team to the website using the FPL API.

7. We need to make a Lambda layer that includes Pandas.

8. We need to deploy our code to Lambda and add a trigger to run the code every day.
